1. **User Query Processing**:
   - Extracts phone number or order ID from the input.
   - Retrieves corresponding details from the SQLite database.
2. **Contextual Search with FAISS**:
   - Stores and searches historical customer data to provide relevant responses.
3. **AI-Based Response Generation**:
   - Uses Groq APIâ€™s Gemma2-9b-it model to generate intelligent responses.
   - Responds in the user's preferred language.
4. **Complaint Management**:
   - If an issue is unresolved, AISHA generates a ticket number and logs the complaint.
   - Ensures a structured workflow for issue resolution.
